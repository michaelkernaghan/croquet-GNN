# croquet-GNN
A deep learning project for Croquet using Graphical Neural Network

Modeling a game like association rules croquet using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) involves several steps, primarily focusing on representing the game elements and interactions as a graph where nodes represent entities (like balls and hoops) and edges represent relationships or interactions (like ball hitting another or passing through a hoop). Here's a step-by-step approach to help you get started:

### 1. Define the Graph Structure

First, you need to define what each node and edge in the graph represents. For a game like croquet:

- **Nodes** could represent the balls, players, hoops, and other game elements.
- **Edges** could represent the interactions such as which ball can hit another, which ball goes through which hoop, distances between balls, etc.

### 2. Feature Representation

Each node can have features. For example:
- For balls: position, color, status (e.g., whether it has passed through all its hoops).
- For players: score, number of turns taken, etc.
- For hoops: position, whether it has been passed through by a particular ball.

### 3. Define the Rules as Edge Relationships

You can encode the rules of croquet as the interactions (edges) between nodes:
- Possible moves from current positions.
- Scoring based on interactions (e.g., a ball passing through a hoop).

### 4. Graph Neural Network Model

You can use a GNN model to predict outcomes like the next best move or to simulate the progression of the game based on current states. The GNN can learn to embed complex relationships and rules of the game into its structure.

### 5. Implementation Using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how you might start implementing this in PyTorch using PyTorch Geometric, which is a library specifically for working with graph data in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torch_geometric.data import Data
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

# Example node features: [x_position, y_position, has_passed_hoop]
node_features = torch.tensor([
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 1, 0]
], dtype=torch.float)

# Example edges: (node1, node2)
edge_index = torch.tensor([
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2],
    [2, 0]
], dtype=torch.long).t().contiguous()

# Create graph
data = Data(x=node_features, edge_index=edge_index)

class CroquetGNN(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CroquetGNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(data.num_features, 16)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(16, 2)  # Assume 2 output features

    def forward(self, x, edge_index):
        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = torch.relu(x)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        return x

model = CroquetGNN()
out = model(data.x, data.edge_index)
print(out)
```

```
> python3 croquetgnn.py       
tensor([[ 0.0505, -0.2955],
        [ 0.0486, -0.1599],
        [ 0.1135, -0.1635]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)
```


### 6. Training the Model

To train the model, you'll need data generated from various game states and outcomes. Training could be supervised (predicting next moves from game states) or reinforcement learning (learning strategy by playing the game).

### 7. Enhancements and Complexity

As the model grows more complex, you might add more sophisticated features like player strategy, wind effects on ball movement, or probabilistic outcomes of hits.

Graph Neural Networks are powerful in capturing complex relational data, making them suitable for applications like simulating games where interactions are key. If you're new to PyTorch Geometric, going through its documentation and tutorials will be very helpful.
